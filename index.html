                            Anyone who visits Grapevine can currently browse through proposed legislation in Ohio and search for legislation via keywords. 
                            This is the starting point for having more informed citizens. Even if most Grapevine users don’t want to research legislation themselves, 
                            they can still learn about legislation from people that do research the legislation. 
                            They can do this through the next component of the site, the discussion board.

                            board to discuss anything related to Ohio. Here users will be able to learn from each other and promote 
                            positive and educational conversation through an upvoting system. There will be rules and a three strike system 
                            that results in six month bans from the discussion board.

                            proposed legislation. From either researching legislation directly or learning about legislation through the
                            discussion board, citizens will be more informed on legislation. Using the results from this unofficial 
                            voting we will be able to generate important and accurate data that helps voters and their representatives

                            Grapevine’s ultimate goal is to be a tool that supplements representative democracy. We want to start by
                            helping the people of Ohio stay engaged with their state politics. We want to generate information that can
                            help voters make decisions on election day.

                                As citizens we always hear others complain about politics and say things like “the system is broken” or 
                                “they don’t represent us.” We complain but we don’t really do anything to change the situation. We just
                                elect new people into the same system.<br><br>

                                Grapevine is here to change the situation and help the system. Grapevine is a site for civic engagement in Ohio. Grapevine doesn’t want
                                to change how legislation is officially voted on. Grapevine wants to create a new digital tool for 
                                citizens to use to participate in democracy. A digital tool that modernizes the way we interact with 
                                representatives because the current methods are inefficient.<br><br>

                                Think about the current ways to contact a representative: telephone, email, letter, and fax. They can be good ways to contact a 
                                representative, but they all require serious manual labor if you want to keep record of people’s 
                                opinions. This is a difficult task when representatives in Ohio represent an average of 116,000 people.
                                It makes sense to build a digital tool like Grapevine where technology can assist with processing the
                                information.
